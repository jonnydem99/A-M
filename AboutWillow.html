        <h1 >Willow (1988)</h1>
        <h3 id="forgotten">The forgotten lucas film</h3>
        <p>Willow was born of the creative genius of George Lucas and brought to life by Ron Howard. The movie was a mild success when it was released in 1988 but has grown into a cult classic.
            So much so, that a sequel series is being developed. As a fan myself, I am excited to talk about Willow and get you caught up on the movie before the series is released on Disney Plus.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before we get into the fun part where I get to tell you about the best movie ever made.
            Here is the data that shows how well other Lucas Films did in comparison to Willow.
            The following list is all Lucas Films movies ranked by their box office performances.
            So, highest grossing movie at the top and least grossing movie at the bottom. 
            It's really not surprise why it has taken them 31 years to get around to a Willow sequel.

            <h3 id="merch">Merchandise</h3>
            <p>Because of it's relatively weak release, there was not a whole
                lot of merchandise made to support the movie. There was certainly 
                an initial attempt to help promote the movie before it's releae though.
                That is evident in the toys and other merchandise that was made at the time.
                There are always action figures, VHS tapes, and other licensed items
                available on eBay. Check it out <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR2.TRC0.A0.H0.XWillow+1988.TRS0&_nkw=Willow+1988&_sacat=0"><em>HERE</em></a>.
