Project - To build a dynamic single page app that uses Giphy API to search and display gifs.

Using the search input and search button, the user can search for gifs using keywords of his/her choice.

Technologies Used - html, css, sass, jquery, javascript

Ideas for future improvement - 
	1. featured gifs section that displays popular gifs 
	2. add functionality that allows 'return' or 'enter' key to trigger search
	3. another page that has the ability to search memes
